## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Difficulties I had while building the website was not being able to fully understand how to save newer changes from VSCode into Github. Another challenge was the second answer for Challenge 3 about Javascript's template/string literals which the const variable must be defined to a certain result and when run into the console log, the output would show the text of the data rather than the literal structure. I am excited to learn an in depth of Javascript and using GitHub by focusing on const variables that match the element ids from previous HTML and CSS files.
